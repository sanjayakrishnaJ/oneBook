# oneBook
A single book which acts as a Comprehensive guide, in various domains. 

All aspiring writers, people who are knowledgeable in a particular subject can come together and join this movement to create a single book which acts as a starting point for students. The aim is to filter information from 100s of books for a particular subject and create a single copy with zero redundancy. Also, as we go the degree level, the subjects start intertwining to other domains, so overlapping subjects are merged instead of studying them as different subjects. Prime example of this is the overlap between Operating systems, Embedded programming, etc. Therefore, a flow is maintained from start to finish by merging overlapping topics, and not seperating subjects, and contains everything that's a need-to-know basis to be considered as a graduate in a domain. Therefore, Computer Science oneBook contains the maths, the hardware, the software, the future, and everything is interconnected to form a continuous flow from start to finish. An Electronics oneBook contains the maths, the physics, the chemistry and hardware and software components knowledge required to have atleast the basic knowledge in the field.
